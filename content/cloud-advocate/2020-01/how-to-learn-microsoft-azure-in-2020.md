# HOW TO LEARN MICROSOFT AZURE IN 2020

The year 2019 is almost over, and usually, we take the time to look back at the year and also to find some New Year‚Äôs resolutions for the new year. Why not take all that energy and prepare for the cloud computing era and advance your career by learning Microsoft Azure. In this post, I try to give you a quick look at how you can get started to learn Microsoft Azure in 2020.

## Azure hands-on experience

There is nothing better than hands-on experience, so get started with a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?WT.mc_id=thomasmaurer-blog-thmaure). Your Azure free account includes a limited quantity of free services for 12 months.

[Microsoft Learn](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2018/10/microsoft-learn/) was introduced at Ignite 2018 as a free learning platform for a lot of different Microsoft technologies, not just Azure. [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=thomasmaurer-blog-thmaure) provides you with various learning paths depending on your job role or the skills you are looking for. Most of the learning paths give you a hands-on learning opportunity so that you can develop practical skills through interactive training. And it is free!

### Microsoft Learn üéì

Up your game with a module or learning path tailored to today‚Äôs IT Pro, developer, and technology masterminds and designed to prepare you for industry-recognized Microsoft certifications.

## Become Microsoft Azure Certified

Another great option to learn and verify your skills is to take Microsoft Azure certification exams. A couple of months back, I wrote a series of blog posts on [why you should become Microsoft Azure certified](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/08/why-you-should-become-microsoft-azure-certified/), [how you prepare for Microsoft Azure exams](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/09/how-to-prepare-and-pass-a-microsoft-azure-exam/), and [how you take and pass Microsoft certification exams](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/09/tips-on-how-to-take-microsoft-azure-certification-exams/). Taking the new role-based Microsoft certification exams will help you to find the right topics and structure to learn, depending on your current or future job role you are looking for.
